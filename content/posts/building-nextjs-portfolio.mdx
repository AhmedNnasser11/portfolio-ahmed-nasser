Welcome to my new blog! In this post, I'll walk you through the architecture of this portfolio.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides the best-in-class developer experience and performance. With the App Router, we can leverage Server Components for fast initial loads while keeping the client-side interaction smooth with Framer Motion.

```tsx
export default function BlogPost() {
  return <div>Hello World</div>;
}
```

## Key Features

1. **Performance**: Static site generation by default.
2. **Animation**: Smooth transitions with Framer Motion.
3. **Theming**: Native dark mode support.

Stay tuned for more updates!
